# Stapler

A remake of classic Macintosh app called [Stapler](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/stapler-11) from 1992.

There was a similar app made for Mac OS X called [LaunchList](http://hasseg.org/launchList/) in 2009.

## What is it?

It's a window of aliases which can be managed, inspected and launched.

The idea is you would set up a window per project containing related apps, documents, folders.

Then you can open them all at once by double clicking the Stapler document.
